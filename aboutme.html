											<h2>About Me</h2>
											<h3>Let me tell you who I am behind the scenes</h3>
										</header>
										<img src="/images/alistairandi.png" />
										<p>
											My Name is Havin Proud (Pronounced Hay-vin). I was born in texas and was raised in Ft Leonardwood Missouri. I Enjoy spending time with My wife and son.
										</p>
										<p>
											In 2019 I reached my life`s goal to become a Paramedic. I enjoyed being able to help people and to know that I made a huge impact on many lives throughout my career. In 2022 I was attending online classes and took an Intro to Software Developement class which sparked a new passion in my life, coding.
										</p>
											<p>

												In 2023 I embarked on a journey with App Academy to achieve my new goal of becoming a Software Developer. Along the way my 10 year old son has watched me build different applications and has expressed his love to code. Now he and I enjoy spending time reading through code and discussing what we can build next.
											</p>
											<p>
												Throughout both my personal and professional experiences, I have discovered I have a very laid-back personality and that I   can also express great empathy for others. In addition,  I believe that the respect I showed to my peers and the respect I earned from them, not only had a lasting  impact on me personally but was also a large part of the succeses I achieved in the professional areas of my life. Mutual respect is important when communicating with others.
												One more area that I feel I am strong in is maintaining a positive attitude towards my work and my interactions with my peers. This positively has been a key factor in my approach to the many challenges I have faced, and has given me the ability to explore many different solutions to problems.
